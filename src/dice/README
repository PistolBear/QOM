QOM/src/dice

This package is for modeling all randomly generated options in the game.  
Dice are the most ubiquitous, but there are also generators for Names, Terrain, Dialog, Backgrounds, Encounters, etc.

The actual creation of entities (i.e., for Encounter generation) will be handled by using randomization within this package
and applying it to instances of QOMs from the QOM/src/X packages.  For instance, creating an encounter will require making
new instances of creatures, which may use the /characterClasses package.
